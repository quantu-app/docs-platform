# The Tree of Knowledge

The Tree of Knowledge on QUANTU is essential a hierarchical (tree) of fields and subfields of human knowledge.
It is designed to categorize learning content and eventually build out a full learning tree filled with value
learning resources for a variety of knowledge domains.

## The Three Main Branches of Scientific Knowledge
1. Formal Sciences (FORMAL)
2. Natural Sciences (NATURAL)
3. Social Sciences (SOCIAL)

### Formal Sciences

We consider the main branches of formal science to be:

```
1. Logic [LOGIC] - The study of rules of inference and analysis of arguments.
2. Mathematics [MATH] - The study of quantity, structure, space and change.
3. Statistics [STATS] - The study of the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.
4. Systems Science [SYSTEMS] - The study of systems, either natural or human made.
5. Decision Theory [CHOICE] - The study of an agent's choices.
6. Theoretical Computer Science [CS] - The study of the mathematical aspects of computer science such as the theory of computation, lambda calculus and type theory.
```

### Natural Sciences

```
1. Earth Science [EARTH]
2. Space Science [SPACE]
3. Physics [PHYS]
4. Chemistry [CHEM]
```

### Social Sciences

```
1. Psychology [PSY]
2. Economics [ECON]
3. History [HIST]
4. Education [EDU]
```
