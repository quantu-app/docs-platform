QUANTU’s Data Policy (English Version)

QUANTU’’s goal is to build a great learning platform. In order to achieve this, we collect data about how our users behave, our platform simply wouldn’t be able to provide an optimal user experience if we didn’t. This text describes what data we collect and how we use it.

One important thing you should know is that our main goal is to only collect data that helps us build a better product for you, our user.

Here’s some other things you should know right up front.

1. We don’t sell your data to any third party services. 
2. The analytics we do use Google Analytics to understand how users interact with our website. We use this data to prioritize upcoming product features and determine how well marketing ideas work.

Here’s what we collect in order to authenticate you during sign-up and login.
1. A first name and last name, but only if you decide to give them to us.
2. An email address from your login provider, i.e. if you login or sign up with a google account, we store the email address associated with that account, so we can identify you and allow you to login to our platform with one click in the future.

Here’s what we collect about you when you are using our platform:
1. We store the data you create and associate it with your account.
2. Nothing else.

If you decide to delete your account, we delete everything you ever created on this platform. The only exceptions are things we are required by law to store for tax purposes, such as payment receipts and billing information.

The bottom line is that we try our best to be good stewards of your data and we strive to only collect and store those pieces which are absolutely necessary to make the product better for all our users.
