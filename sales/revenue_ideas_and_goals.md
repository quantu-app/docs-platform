# Revenue Ideas & Goals

## Goal 1: Sustainability

Why do we need money? Answer: it cost money just to run the service.
We will always try to keep operational costs at a minimum, but that must be balanced with app performance, 
however, I think we can keep operational costs, hopefully very low for a long time.

1. Obtain sufficient revenue to support running the service.


## Goal 2: Content Creator and Developer Livelihood

We want full and even part-time content creators to be able to earn money - and not just limited minor funds - the maximum amount possible from working on the platform and creating fantastic content. Ideally enough so that those which are passionate about creating learning content and really capable in this area can just focus on doing that full-time.

On the software side of things, we have two groups. First, there is our open source software that we provide to the community as, hopefully, useful tools with a license that makes it so anyone can use it the FOSS sense (not that it must be free of cost, but that they can modify it, examine it, reuse it, etc.). Anyway, the users of the software are free to provide their input and code changes back or not or modify the code how they see fit. However, there are also parts of QUANTU which are not libraries but are the core applications and services themselves. These too should be open source, however, there will most likely be a much smaller group of core developers working full time on building the application, resolving bugs, and ensuring that the QUANTU platform is running optimally. I would like these developers to be able to earn a salary and focus full-time on building out the platform. If possible it would be amazing if even contributors to our FOSS libraries could get some payouts as well, though I'm not exactly sure how all this can work.

The bottom line is we want to community to be able to earn money by working as a community on the product. I think this means we want some type of OSS license which requires users of our libraries to pay us some percentage of their earnings if they use our libraries commercially, I'm thinking of EPIC's license or something along those lines. It should only effect those capable of paying the money and not be applicable to smaller or indie developers or those with limited revenues.

So high quality open source software with a fair licensing model is one way to earn some money for the community.

I think we could also charge for some content on the platform via a subscription model, especially if we allow those incapable of making the subscription payments to send an application for exception. This still allows us to provide free education to everyone as well as giving us a revenue stream from those willing and capable of paying for the service. 

The key here might be to make content from subscriptions "extras" such as perhaps learning paths designed for mastering GRE or SAT tests. Another ideas is as a subscriber getting the ability to make roadmap and course recommendations and provide direct feedback to the developer and content creator communities.

We could also provide an additional mobile app and extra learning games which are available only to subscribers as well.

In summary:

1. Explore fair subscriptions to avoid ads and still provide anyone incapable of making a payment with access.
2. Explore OSS licensing models for potentially earning some revenue from licensing.
3. The main goal - provide the diverse community with resources for earning revenue.

### First Steps

1. Start with Patreon, as the community grows we can figure out how to automate or move to another model later.
